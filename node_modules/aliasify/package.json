  "readme": "Aliasify is a [transform](https://github.com/substack/node-browserify#btransformtr) for [browserify](https://github.com/substack/node-browserify) which lets you rewrite calls to `require`.\n\nInstallation\n============\n\nInstall with `npm install --save-dev aliasify`.\n\nUsage\n=====\n\nTo use, add a section to your package.json:\n\n    {\n        \"aliasify\": {\n            aliases: {\n                \"d3\": \"./shims/d3.js\"\n                \"underscore\": \"lodash\"\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\nNow if you have a file in src/browserify/index.js which looks like:\n\n    d3 = require('d3')\n    _ = require('underscore')\n    ...\n\nThis will automatically be transformed to:\n\n    d3 = require('../../shims/d3.js')\n    _ = require('lodash')\n    ...\n\nAny replacement that starts with a \".\" will be resolved as a relative path (as \"d3\" above.)  Replacements that start with any other character will be replaced verbatim (as with \"underscore\" above.)\n\nConfiguration\n=============\n\nConfiguration can be loaded in multiple ways;  You can put your configuration directly in package.json, as in the example above, or you can use an external json or js file.  In your package.json:\n\n    {\n        \"aliasify\": \"./aliasifyConfig.js\"\n    }\n\nThen in aliasifyConfig.js:\n\n    module.exports = {\n        aliases: {\n            \"d3\": \"./shims/d3.js\"\n        },\n        verbose: false\n    };\n\nNote that using a js file means you can change your configuration based on environment variables.\n\nAlternatively, if you're using the Browserify API, you can configure your aliasify programatically:\n\n    aliasify = require('aliasify').configure({\n        aliases: {\n            \"d3\": \"./shims/d3.js\"\n        },\n        configDir: __dirname,\n        verbose: false\n    });\n\nnote that `configure()` returns a new `aliasify` instance.\n\nConfiguration options:\n* `aliases` - An object mapping aliases to their replacements.\n* `verbose` - If true, then aliasify will print modificiations it is making to stdout.\n* `configDir` - An absolute path to resolve relative paths against.  If you're using package.json, this will automatically be filled in for you with the directory containing package.json.  If you're using a .js file for configuration, set this to `__dirname`.\n* `appliesTo` - Controls which files will be transformed.  By default, only JS type files will be transformed ('.js', '.coffee', etc...).  See [browserify-trasnform-tools documentation](https://github.com/benbria/browserify-transform-tools/wiki/Transform-Configuration#common-configuration) for details.\n\nRelative Requires\n=================\n\nWhen you specify:\n\n    aliases: {\n        \"d3\": \"./shims/d3.js\"\n    }\n\nThe \"./\" means this will be resolved relative to the configuration file which contains the line.\nSometimes it is desirable to literally replace an alias; to resolve the alias relative to the\nfile which is doing the `require` call.  In this case you can do:\n\n    aliases: {\n        \"d3\": {\"relative\": \"./shims/d3.js\"}\n    }\n\nThis will cause all occurences of `require(\"d3\")` to be replaced with `require(\"./shims/d3.js\")`,\nregardless of where those files are in the directory tree.\n\n\nAlternatives\n============\n\n`aliasify` is essentially a fancy version of the [`browser` field](https://gist.github.com/defunctzombie/4339901#replace-specific-files---advanced) from package.json, which is [interpreted](https://github.com/substack/node-browserify#packagejson) by browserify.\n\nUsing the `browser` field is probably going to be faster, as it doesn't involve running a transform on each of your files.  On the other hand, `aliasify` gives you a finer degree of control and can be run before other transforms (for example, you can run `aliasify` before [debowerify](https://github.com/eugeneware/debowerify), which will let you replace certain components that debowerify would otherwise replace.)\n\n",
